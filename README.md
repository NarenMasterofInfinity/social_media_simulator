1. Don't have function definitions in classes.h. Add any attritute or definition that you find necessary but make sure that any change is known to anyone that share your class.
2. Push your file into main branch only if it runs smoothly or give proper names to the commits to signify the mistake so that others don't have to deal with it.
3. Happy coding!
